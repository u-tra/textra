## What is Textra?
It’s a simple tool that automates your typing, saving you from the repetitive grind.By typing defined keys textra allows automated typing of any amount of text information defined for the specific key.

If you’re anything like me, you’ve got tasks that require you to type the same things over and over. Maybe you’re sending **10+ emails a day** with phrases like “Please find the attached document as requested.” After a while, that gets **annoying**, right?

That’s where **Textra** comes in. 

## Why Use Textra?

### Save Time by Automating Repetitive Typing
Once installed Textra allows the user to automatically type/input predefined information of any length at cursor location by only typing their respective defined keys or abbreviations effectively replacing them.

Instead of typing the same email lines over and over, just set up a rule:
```
pfa => Please find the attached document as requested.
```
Once Textra is allowed to run in the background.Now, every time you type "pfa," Textra replaces it with the full sentence. You don’t need to think about it—it just works, **anywhere** you can type. Emails, Word documents, chat messages—Textra has you covered.

### Universal Text Automation
Textra isn’t tied to a specific app. It works anywhere you’re typing: email clients, chat apps, word processors, code editors. It runs quietly in the background, catching your shortcuts no matter what program you're using.

### Multiple Shortcuts
Got multiple ways you refer to something? No problem. You can set up multiple triggers for the same text:
```
:email | :mail => a@xo.rs
```
Type `:email` or `:mail`, and Textra will automatically insert your full email address.

### Multi-Line Text Blocks
Need to insert a whole paragraph or your email signature? Textra can handle that too. You can set up multi-line text replacements:
```
:signature => `Best regards,
John Doe
Project Manager`
```
When you type `:signature`, Textra drops in the entire block for you.
